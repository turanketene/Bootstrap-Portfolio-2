# Bootstrap-Portfolio-2
## Name: Bootstrap Portfolio-2

## Description: 
Bootstrap allows us to save time on creating websites because it provides us with pre-made templates and content that we can use for our websites. It also is very helpful with mobile responsiveness so it prevents further work on a css file to add media queries. In this project, content and components were used from the Bootstrap website to recreate the portfolio from week 1. Main contents that were used were the nav bar, responsive grid layout, responsive images,  and forms.

## Usage:
This project can be used to see how a bootstrap template can be used to make websites. By picking  the right contents that were interested in and modifying it according to what we need on the website, a user can save a lot of time when creating websites.
